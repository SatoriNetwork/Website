To create the Terms of Service (ToS), I need the following information:

Introduction:

Welcome to the Satori Neuron software ("Software"). These Terms of Service ("ToS") govern your use of the Software, which is provided by The Satori Association ("we", "us", "our"). By using the Software, you agree to be bound by these ToS.

The purpose of these ToS is to outline the rules and guidelines for using the Software and to ensure that all users understand their rights and responsibilities. The Software subscribes to real-world data streams, makes predictions about those data streams, and shares those predictions with other Satori neurons, forming a future-predicting network.
